## 2. Global-Level Communication Guidelines {#global-guidelines}

### A. Keep Your Language Clear and Simple

**Best Practices:**
- Use short sentences (15-20 words maximum)
- Avoid slang, jargon, or regional expressions
- Choose universal English terms
- Break complex information into bullet points

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Let's circle back on this ASAP to leverage our synergies."
- ✅ "Let's schedule a follow-up meeting this week to discuss how we can work together effectively."

**Why This Matters:**
Clear communication reduces misunderstandings across language barriers and cultural differences. Simple language ensures your message is understood by non-native English speakers.

### B. Be Professional and Polite

**Essential Phrases:**
- "Please" and "Thank you" in every request
- "I appreciate your patience" during delays
- "I understand your concern" when addressing issues
- "May I clarify..." to ensure understanding

**Tone Guidelines:**

**DO:**
- Remain calm and neutral
- Focus on solutions, not problems
- Use inclusive language
- Acknowledge emotions respectfully

**AVOID:**
- Sarcasm or irony
- Aggressive or defensive language
- Blame or accusations
- Overly casual expressions

**Real-World Example:**
When a customer is upset about a service issue:
- ❌ "It's not our fault, the system failed."
- ✅ "I understand your frustration, and I'm here to help resolve this for you."

### C. Confirm Understanding

**Confirmation Phrases:**
- "Just to confirm..." (before restating key points)
- "If I understand correctly..." (to verify understanding)
- "Let me summarize..." (to recap important details)

**Active Listening Techniques:**
- Paraphrase what you heard
- Ask open-ended questions
- Take notes during conversations
- Follow up with written summaries

**Example Implementation:**
"Let me confirm my understanding. You're saying that the server downtime affected your morning operations, and you need assurance this won't happen again. Is that correct?"

### D. Stay Neutral and Calm

**Emotional Regulation Strategies:**
- Take deep breaths before responding to emotional messages
- Focus on facts and solutions, not emotions
- Use "I" statements instead of "you" statements
- Maintain professional distance while showing empathy

**Crisis Communication Approach:**
1. Acknowledge the situation immediately
2. Provide regular updates
3. Be transparent about limitations
4. Focus on resolution steps
